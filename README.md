Here's a `readme.md` for the provided script:

# Git Auto Commit (GAC) Script

A Python script that uses my [ChatFreePT](https://chatfreept.example.com) API to generate standardized commit messages based on Git diff logs. The script then commits these messages to the repository.

## Usage

Run the script with the following commands:

```bash
git add <files>
python gac.py [--headless] [--log]
```

- `--headless`: Run the script in headless mode (optional).
- `--log`: Enable logging (optional).

## Description

The purpose of this script is to automate the process of creating commit messages following the conventional style for Git commits. It uses the Git diff logs to generate concise and informative commit messages. The commit messages are structured with a type (e.g., feat, fix, docs) and a description of why the changes were made.

The script interacts with the ChatFreePT API to generate commit messages based on the Git diff logs. It then prefixes the commit messages with `[gac]` before committing the changes to the repository.

## How It Works

1. The script retrieves the Git diff logs for staged changes using the `git diff --staged` command.
2. It sends the diff logs to the ChatFreePT API to generate a commit message following the conventional style.
3. The generated commit message is prefixed with `[gac]`.
4. The script commits the changes with the generated commit message using the `git commit` command.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.6+)
- [ChatFreePT](https://chatfreept.example.com) API
- Git

## Note

This script is designed to simplify the process of creating standardized commit messages. Make sure to customize the script according to your specific requirements and integrate it into your development workflow.
